In this lesson we will try to program the following:

  1. Write a program that prints the rank of each process
  2. Write a program such that each rank sends a string to the root, and root prints it
  3. Write a program that computes the sum of ranks with a reduction
  4. Write a program that computes the sum of vectors (one for each rank, with length 10 and values equal to the rank itself) with a reduction
