Here&#8217;s an *incomplete *list of links where you can find scientific papers on parallel and distributed computing.

First you should try <a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="https://scholar.google.it">Google Scholar</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> (search for everything), then if you want to search for <em>specific publishers</em>:</span>

  * [ACM][1]
  * [IEEE][2]
  * [Springer][3]
  * [Elsevier][4]
  * [Wiley][5]

**Beware of Google Scholar**: it searches also for *predatory publishers*, in other words, junk journal with questionable peer reviews. You can find a *list of predatory publishers* in the famous [Beall&#8217;s list][6].
