I will be absent from the University, please contact me via mail. Note: I could take more than one day to respond.

### For the students of Mobile Computing

Please send **a link** to a video of your app **running on a real smartphone** (a **real one**, no simulators), and in my place, Prof. Crescenzi will regularize your grades on the GOMP platform.

Be sure you send me:

- brief description of the app
- link of the video **so that I can download it**
- names and surnames


Thank you.
