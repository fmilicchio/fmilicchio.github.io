  <h2>Distributed Computing (held 2009-2015)</h2>
</header>


<p>WHAT. The primary objective of the course is to introduce students to te concepts of  parallel  and  distributed  computing.</p>

<p>WHY. Ever heard of  cloud computing, or  map-reduce? Well, have you wondered how things are really under the hood? That's why.</p>

<p>HOW. Distributed and parallel algorithms are harder to design, analyze, and implement with respect to their serial counterparts. Let's be honest:  there is no silver bullet . Not everything can be a map and a reduce, not everything can (or should) be parallelized. In this course we will learn how to think about parallelization, showing limits, problems, and hands-on solutions.</p>

<p>WHO. These algorithms play central role in modern computing, e.g., cloud computing, and applied in several fields, from bioinformatics to web services, from structural engineering to entertainment. Needless to say: almost every aspect of modern computing will be distributed.</p>
