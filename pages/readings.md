	<h2>Recommended Books</h2>
</header>

<p>One important thing: <strong>if you stop studying you will end up being obsolete</strong>. Always learn new things for yourself, not for your grades. This is perfectly explained in the book "<em>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</em>", one of the best books you can read for your profession.</p>

<p>The following is a list of books that students asked me to write in my courses. It comprises a series of books that I've found  useful or interesting, and so I recommend reading for your own personal and professional interest. </p>
