					<h3>Ani<em>mesh</em>on</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Computational models are used everywhere, from games to movies&mdash;e.g., special effects, animations&mdash;and deformations are the basic tool for animating objects, so we focus on a particular aspect of the vast morphing research field. In particular, movies are created with a technique called key-frame animation, where animators deform meshes from one point in time to another, and the transition should be smooth.</p>

					<h3>Incourant</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Future movie and gaming industries will employ more and more accurate and numerically reliable methods for animations and rendering. These methods, for instance the Finite Element Method (FEM), are employed for not only for entertainment, but also for simulating old and new materials, applying  Navier-Stokes equations for fluid mechanics in physical engines (e.g., fog, water, air), or a mixture of methods for interacting bodies.</p>

					<h3>NeuroLab</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Among the manufacturers of EEG machines, we have Micromed. They have a file format, VWR, that is proprietary, and there is just a viewer for Windows. But I needed a macOS viewer because I've seen my wife not being able to open their files on her Apple laptop. Apart from personal reasons, it was a while since I worked in assembly and reverse engineered binaries. It sounded like fun, and I had definitely fun.</p>
