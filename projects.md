					<h3>Animations</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Computational models are used everywhere, from games to movies&mdash;e.g., special effects, animations&mdash;and deformations are the basic tool for animating objects, so we focus on a particular aspect of the vast morphing research field. In particular, movies are created with a technique called key-frame animation, where animators deform meshes from one point in time to another, and the transition should be smooth.</p>

					<h3>Physics Engines</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Future movie and gaming industries will employ more accurate and numerically reliable methods for animations and rendering. These methods, for instance the Finite Element Method (FEM), are employed for not only for entertainment, but also for simulating old and new materials, applying  Navier-Stokes equations for fluid mechanics in physical engines (e.g., fog, water, air), or a mixture of methods for interacting bodies.</p>
